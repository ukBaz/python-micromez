Update Version Info
-------------------
Use bumpversion package to update all references at once.
This library tries to use `Semantic Versioning
<https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200>`_

Semantic version uses three numbers that represent ``major.minor.patch``.

The bumpversion command allows you to choose which to update. In the
following example the version is being updated for a patch.

.. code-block:: none

    bumpversion patch setup.py


Build PyPI package
------------------

Update version information in setup.py.

To upload to PyPI:

.. code-block:: none

    python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    twine upload dist/*


Test Build of Documentation
---------------------------

Do a test build of the documentation and then a visual inspection.
To do a local build of the documentation:

.. code-block:: none

    cd docs
    make clean
    make html

* readthedocs gets update from GitHub
* readthedocs versions are based on GitHub version tags
